# Singapore's Covid-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (Vaccination, Hospitalisation, Cases, Deaths)
Self-collected and self-recorded Covid-19 data daily from Singapore's Ministry of Health from 1 August 2021 to 31 August 2021. By using the data, visualisation is applied. To conclude, Singapore's vaccination rate has helped to see drops in hospital admissions.

Future Work: If possible, add August 2021's daily death data from Immigration & Checkpoints Authority to the dataframe to further prove that vaccination rate has no association with deaths as claimed by the anti-vaxxers that vaccine injuries induced deaths.
